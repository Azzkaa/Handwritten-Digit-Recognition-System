# Handwritten Digit Recognition System

This project focuses on developing a Handwritten Digit Recognition System using machine learning techniques. The system leverages the MNIST dataset, a collection of images representing handwritten digits from 0 to 9. A neural network model was built and trained using TensorFlow to identify these digits accurately. The project involved data preprocessing, model training, evaluation using test datasets, and implementing advanced techniques like data augmentation and transfer learning to enhance the model's performance. The goal was to create a robust system that can accurately classify handwritten numbers, simulating human recognition abilities.
